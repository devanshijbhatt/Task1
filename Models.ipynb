Mohsin Khan Abbasi, CEO of Pak Star Group of Companies gave her gifts as an encouragement for converting to Islam. Abbasi said that his intention is to ensure that Anju faces no issues and feels at home in Pakistan. He said that his company decided to provide a plot of 272 square feet to Anju to build a house, an India Today report said. Another thing is when someone comes to a new place, the main problem is housing. Since we have a project running, we thought we can accommodate them here. Our board of directors approved it and we the plot in her name, Abbasi was heard saying in a video. Anju received 10 Marla housing land, cheque of 50K, other Gifts, given by Islamabad Based businessman CEO of Pak Star Group of Companies Mohsin Khan Abbasi. CEO PSG said that, Anju has converted to Islam and married Nasrullah, so we are welcoming her. #AnjuNasrullahLoveStory pic.twitter.com/22j5CWM9LCâ€” Ghulam Abbas Shah (@ghulamabbasshah) July 29, 2023 Abbasi further urged other businessmen, Pakistani government and the people of the country to support the newly married couple, Nasrullah and Fatima. He said that it is important to make Pakistan feel like home for her, adding that, she should feel valued after she left her home and family in India to marry Nasrullah and embrace Islam. Following her travel to Pakistan, Anju's husband Arvind Kumar said that they are not divorced yet and so she cannot get married there. She claimed that she submitted divorce papers three years ago in Delhi but no such notice has reached him yet, he said. On papers, she is still my wife. She cannot marry anyone else. The government should get the matter investigated, Arvind Kumar added. Anju's father, Gaya Prasad Thomas said that she is mentally disturbed and eccentric. He said that although she is free of nature, she would never get involved in anything like this. The 34-year-old Anju, born in Kailor village in Uttar Pradesh was a resident of Alwar district. She became friends with the 29-year-old Pakistani national, Nasrullah on Facebook in 2019. She travelled via te Wagah-Attari border to a remote village in the tribal province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on a valid Pakistani visa to meet Nasrullah.

I assure tourists that things are coming back to normal and Himachal Pradesh is safe to travel now. You can come to enjoy the natural beauty of the state and the government would make all efforts to ensure that your stay is safe and all facilities are provided to you, he said in a video.Relief And Rescue Ops In StateThe state government had safely evacuated about 75,000 tourists from different parts of the state recently.Videos of landslides blocking roads, tourists stranded, floods damaging buildings, sweeping vehicles and roads caving in causing enormous damage to life and property had gone viral since July 9 and as a result the tourists are apprehensive to travel to the hill state during the ongoing monsoon.So far, 184 persons have died in rain-related incidents and road accidents since June 24 when the monsoon hit the state.Thirty-three people are missing as per the state emergency response centre.(With Inputs from ANI PTI)\",\n",

This stereotype is stuck with the doll for years, despite the numerous new designs and models being introduced. Director Greta Gerwig understood these stereotypes and even plays along with them for the first 15 to 20 minutes of the Barbie movie. However, she shatters the glass as soon as she is done playing with the doll and gets down to business to tell a relatable, feminist, and applaud-worthy movie that lives up to the hype. Barbie, starring Margot Robbie in the lead, is set in Barbie Land which has several kinds of Barbies co-existing. We see the stereotype Barbie (Margot), the President Barbie (Issa Rae), Physicist Barbie (Emma Mackey), and Lawyer Barbie (Sharon Rooney), among many more, running the Barbie land while the men, all of them named Ken, double up as their supporters, lovers, and partners. All goes well in the alter imaginary world until one day, the stereotypical Barbie wakes up feeling unusual emotions. She begins to wonder about death, loses her ability to walk on her toes, and exhibits sad emotions. When she approaches the Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), she learns that a portal between Barbie Land and the real world has led to Barbie feeling human-like emotions. She is advised to visit the real world to find answers. Driving through roads, crossing mountains and seas, Barbie and Ken (Ryan Gosling) roller-blade into Venice Beach in California where they meet Gloria (America Ferrera) and her daughter Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt). While Gloria is still a fan of Barbie, Sasha is not on board with the idea of Barbie and even calls her a fascist on her face. Barbie soon understands that her questions are being answered but Ken goes off on a different journey of self-discovery. He learns that in the real world, men are treated higher than women and that the concept of patriarchy plays to their benefit. Ken returns to Barbie Land and brings about drastic changes. On the other hand, Barbie also lands in her own world with the mother-daughter duo and finds out everything is changing. This leaves her worried. How will Barbie save her world? I recommend you watch the film and find out. Greta, with co-writer Noah Baumbach, delivers a colourful, fresh, and probably one of the best concepts of the year. While the film starts off as though it is portraying a delusional world of Barbies, Greta smashes open the plot and lets you in on her feminist take on the popular doll. She is conveying some of the most powerful messages with the film, she is doing it under the garb of humour and coming-of-age, making the impact stronger. The dialogues and screenplay are the biggest superpowers of Barbie. Greta makes several pop culture references thus adopting the meta narration which helps Barbie take things a notch higher. She also takes digs at Margot Robbie, the concept of Barbie over the years, Warner Bros projects, and patriarchy, leaving everyone in splits. Barbie is so strong in its approach towards surprise humour that it somewhat reminded me of Phoebe Waller-Bridges style of comedy. On the acting front, Margot proves she was meant to play the role of Barbie. The actress shifts gears from being the happy-go-lucky Barbie to the Barbie no one has ever seen before with utmost ease. However, Ryan Gosling steals the show. He channels his inner Kenergy so hard that he outshines Margot in a few scenes. He also shows his comedy side in the goofiest way possible. His rapport with Simu Liu in the film, especially in their musical scenes, is hilarious and you will find yourself asking for more of their scenes. America Ferrera also holds the screen in the film. Her monologue in the film was not only relatable but also very moving. That scene and her performance will be discussed in the days to come. However, she couldn't match up to Margot and Ryan's massive energy in the film. Kate McKinnon as Weird Barbie also knows how to hold the camera's attention but is outshined by Margot. However, Barbie has its share of flaws as well. The climax is based on convenience and shifts focus from Barbie to Ken, which backfires the whole build-up of the film. To top it off, it appeared as though Greta was confused about how to end the film so she brought in a strange subplot to wrap things off, paving the way to several questions but no answers. Bottom Line: Dear Barbies, take your Kens with you to watch the impressive Gret Gerwig directorial because the film talks about the various struggles women go through that men truly need to be reminded of. Watch the film for the dialogue writing and Margot and Ryan's performances.\",\n",

        "\t\"inputs\": \"generate title to this paragraph: 2.\tThe highly anticipated Gadar 2, starring Sunny Deol and Ameesha Patel, is generating excitement among fans. According to a report from Bollywood Hungama, the trailer of Gadar 2 was earlier expected to release on July 27. However, sources close to the production have now claimed otherwise. A source close to the film told News18 exclusively that Gadar 2 makers have preponed their plans for the trailer release. The trailer will now release earlier.  Director Anil Sharma and actor Sunny Deol are now planning to launch it on July 25, said the source. According to the source, the makers of Gadar 2 have devised an interesting promotional strategy. They are relying on the efforts of the actors and director Anil Sharma to generate enough buzz and awareness about the film’s release on August 11. As of now, there has been no official statement from the makers regarding the trailer release. Gadar 2, announced in October 2021, is a remake of the 2001 film Gadar: Ek Prem Katha. Set in post-partition India, the movie portrayed the love story of Sakeena, a Muslim girl and Tara Singh, an Indian Sikh boy. In the first instalment, Tara crossed the border to bring back his wife. Directed by Anil Sharma, who also helmed the original film, Gadar 2 will see his son Utkarsh reprise his role as Tara and Sakeena’s young son Jeete. Earlier, Sunny Deol issued a statement and expressed excitement for the sequel. 'Gadar - Ek Prem Katha has been an eminent part of my life, personally as well as professionally. Tara Singh from Gadar isn't just a protagonist but went on to become a cult icon that defied all odds and crossed all boundaries for his family and love. Collaborating with the team after, 22 years was a creatively enriching experience,' his statement said as quoted by Indian Express.\",\n",
