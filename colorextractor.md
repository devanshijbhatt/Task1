| ColorThief               | [colorthief_output1.png](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tai4NwNkvSgtcTSYqWlCizjJ4JSbx92o/view?usp=drive_link)| Suggests the dominant colors in the image as a palette. ColorThief has minimal dependencies and is easy to install so runs fast. However, ColorThief may not be as efficient for large images or if we need advanced color extraction capabilities. | Free            |
| extcolors                | [Extcolors_output1.png](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YwFBWKaXqhXeZGCVbTCtexHPxebw7gKR/view?usp=drive_link)            | The same output palette as ColorThief but it is more versatile and allows for extracting colors based on various criteria such as minimum pixel count and color distance threshold. It may offer better performance for large images and has dependencies like NumPy and Pillow which we already use. | Free            |
| colorgram                | [colorgram_output1.png](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16gBCXcrHU4-wxBln6BRd8M7bYRtDh2kz/view?usp=drive_link)            | The same output palette as ColorThief and Extcolors, colorgram primarily focuses on extracting the dominant colors from an image. It provides a simple interface for extracting without much customization and is more suitable for smaller images and not for advanced extraction. It has minimal dependencies. | Free            |

But it does have features to generate different kinds of palettes like the palette (the main primary color palette), complementary_palette (the complementary colors palette), least_palette (the least used color palette), most_palette (the most used color palette), similar_palette (the similar color palette to the primary color palette). | Free            |
